# **The OpenSSF Diagrammers Society**
<img align="top" src="https://github.com/ossf/Diagrammers-Society/blob/main/ossf-goose-diagrammer1.png">

We are a group of drawing-enthusiasts who assemble to help craft a series of dynamic images to help convey all the amazing work going on throughout the OpenSSF.

## 
**Motivation**

The OpenSSF is a complex and mysterious ecosystem that may be daunting for particpants to understand where they might be interested in joining in or learning from.

## 
**Objective**

To be able to clearly and simply provide examples of how the OpenSSF is organized, what are the challenges our Working Groups (WG)s and Special Interest Groups (SIG)s are seeking to solve, and how those individual components relate to each other.


## 
**Scope**
Initiatives, Projects, Working Groups, Special Interest Groups, and other collaborative efforts supported by the OpenSSF

[What is in and out of scope]
Non-OpenSSF projects, initiatives, etc.

## 
**Current Results**

The presentation [OpenSSF Introduction (including Diagrammersâ€™ Society diagrams)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZQ7WjNH5fQL7qvpFN3jTFt-iQHqPpUc5of_azQc8iic/edit) is a Google document that includes several diagrams that help explain the OpenSSF, and is the current version of several of these diagrams. It's part of a larger presentation, so that people who want to explain the OpenSSF can immediately use it.

## 
**Prior Work**

In our [meeting notes]( ) we have assesmbled many examples of how the foundation could be articulated in graphic format.

*   [1000s of Words presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Xx-TblYarVTd3g7bLY4ifZx4OEhmSuQweqbjjPEgULw/edit#slide=id.p) a slide deck summarizing the group's work and assorted doodles as shared to the TAC, GB, and other groups.
